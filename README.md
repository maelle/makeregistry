# makeregistry

This is an R package used to create the JSON file in https://github.com/ropensci/roregistry that is in turn used to display packages on ropensci.org/packages.

This package includes one main function, `create_registry()`, which is run in the ["build-registry" workflow in ropensci/registry](https://github.com/ropensci/roregistry/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/build-registry.yml).
